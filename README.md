A study guide for course pre-work.

# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create a space that could house a lot of the things I would learn while going through the Coding Bootcamp. This study guide webpage can assist with studying for the Coding Bootcamp. All the information is organized into categories. It can help guide the user toward the proper things to study for the course. I learned how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript properly to create a well organized study guide. During the processes, I learned how to use Git to keep track of a repository from start to finish.

## Usage

There are four different sections to this study guide: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. Each section contains notes about the given topic. These notes can be used as a study tool to help explain or remind the user about things that are good to remember and study. If the user opens the DevTools console, they can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for the user to study first.
